This gpsserver app is designed to receive data from a Xexun TK102-2 tracker over GPRS connection. It parses the data to a format compatible with gpsseuranta.net data. This app is largely based on tutorial in http://www.tidytutorials.com/2010/06/linux-c-socket-example-with-client.html. You can compile this app with g++, for example "g++ -o gpsserver gpsserver.cpp -lpthread" with source file name changed. Feel free to do what ever you like with this piece of code, just include my name with it if you share it. You can also contact me via email if you like.
